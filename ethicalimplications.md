In undertaking a Note app, there is an ethical concern of security, morally questionable information being stored 
in the system and the ethics of whether our app should forgoe one or the other in order to perserve the other.

When making a note app there is 2 main concerns for the developers of the program.

1. How secure should the information of the notes be for each user?
    a. Should this information be so secured it shall only be accessible by the user and no one else?
    b. Or should the information be secure enough where only the developers or certain developers be allowed to access it along with the user.
2. Should morally reprehensible or illegal information be stored in the notes?
   a.Who determines what should and should not be allowed in the app? 

   b.If a certain guideline is enacted, how should the enforcement of these rules be enacted? Manual? Automatic or user submited review? 

    c.If there is a private not how would the enforcement of this be completed?

By undertaking a note app there must be a balance between security and safety, a bias towards one particular side of the scale can attract attention from those
who could wish to abuse the side of the scale in their power.

For example if we were to as developers lean towards the security side and allow no access for any one from the user to access their private notes, 
it could lead to a prolonged usage of the app to hold irresponsible or morally wrong content.

However, if we are to focus on the usage of the app for filtering and enforcement of all notes,
it could lead to a breach in privacy as we are able to search through and monitor all content that is being passed through our app 
including those that are not legal breaking but considered personal like bank accounts and personal photos

As computer engineers about to enter the workforce, these are questions we must apply to our thinking when considering programs and services. 
Even if it is not the same use cases, our level of thinking for ethical concerns must be the same in order to both cater to what is needed and what is right.
