In undertaking a Note app, there is an ethical concern of security, morally questionable information being stored 
in the system and the ethics of whether our app should forgoe one or the other in order to perserve the other.

When making a note app there is 2 main concerns:

1. How secure should the information of the notes be for each user?
2. Should morally reprehensible or illegal information be stored in the notes?

By undertaking a note app there must be a balance between security and safety, a bias towards one particular side
could tip the scale of balance of the other.

For example if we were to as developers lean towards the security side and allow no access for any one from the user to access their private notes, 
it could lead to a prolonged usage of the app to hold irresponsible or morally wrong content.
This could lead to the storage of potentially life threating material and if found out that our online web program allowed for the sharing and storage of said material with 
absolutely no oversight of such content due to our stance in security it can prove to be quite problamatic for perception and responsibiliy as a developer.

However, if we are to focus on the usage of the app for filtering and enforcement of all notes,
it could lead to a breach in privacy as we are able to search through and monitor all content that is being passed through our app 
including those of a private nature. This could result in the users unknowingly being spied upon on all
matter of data they input through the app from passwords to even trade secrets and reminders that can all be
utilized by others against the user or use to mess with a system. This can also lead to be extremely problamatic if
a data breach happens in which now all the user's data is exposed to those who breached into our systems.

With these 2 main concerns, we as developers should strive to keep the idea of a balance of ethics in mind
to ensure that concerns of these nature are tackled and handled responsibly. As the work one developers 
can impact thousands if not millions of end users.
