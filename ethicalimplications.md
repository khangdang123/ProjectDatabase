In undertaking a Note app, there is an ethical concern of security, morally questionable information being stored 
in the system and the ethics of whether our app should forgoe one or the other in order to perserve the other.

When making a note app there is 2 main concerns:

1. How secure should the information of the notes be for each user?
2. Should morally reprehensible or illegal information be stored in the notes?

By undertaking a note app there must be a balance between security and safety, a bias towards one particular side
could tip the scale of balance of the other.

For example if we were to as developers lean towards the security side and allow no access for any one from the user to access their private notes, 
it could lead to a prolonged usage of the app to hold irresponsible or morally wrong content.

However, if we are to focus on the usage of the app for filtering and enforcement of all notes,
it could lead to a breach in privacy as we are able to search through and monitor all content that is being passed through our app 
including those of a private nature.
